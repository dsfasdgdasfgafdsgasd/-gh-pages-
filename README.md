The mouth is  crossed out and the dot nose is conected to another dot that is conected to 2 lines the are horizontal and vertical that follow your computor cursor while it is on screen.
When you open Lab Assignment five you will get a black screen and a blue dot that is following the computor cursor . If you use your computor mouse and click on the black screen you will get a picture of a bow in white, and once you let go the screen goes to black. However if you press a computor key the screen turns white with that picture of a bow appearing in black. Also you see with the movement of your computor cursor will see a line that is following the blue dot around.
Lab Assignment seven starts with 4 dots 2 of them are moving on there own while the other 2 stand still. However once you move your computor mouse the image rotates with the 2 dots rotating with the movement of the first dot in the middle.
